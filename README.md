## Introduction
Welcome to **Iced-FlatList**, a highly performant virtualized list component for the Iced framework. This library provides an efficient way to render large lists by only rendering the rows that are currently visible on the screen. As a result, it significantly improves performance and reduces memory consumption.

**Please note**: This library is still under development and may not be suitable for production use.

## Features
- **Virtualized Rendering:** Only renders the rows that are currently visible on the screen to optimize performance.
- **Efficient Scrolling:** Smooth scrolling experience even with large data sets.
- **Built for Iced:** Seamlessly integrates with the Iced framework.

## Usage
*Coming Soon:* Detailed usage instructions and examples will be provided once the library is stable and ready for production use.
